### Offline
EasyRadar doesn't require an internet connection at any time. All calculations are done entirely offline.

If you need extra help with a specific step from the help menu, you can get even more information for that specific section by clicking the adjacent question mark.

### Free
EasyRadar is completely free to download and use, and it doesn't have any advertisements or in-app purchases to ruin the fluid experience.

### Compact
EasyRadar is both digitally and visually compact, so you can take it anywhere you go, even if you don't have much onboard storage.
